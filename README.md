# Sanity Template

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

an unopinionated starter kit for designers like me who want to create a modern React + Tailwind site but don't want to have to debug five fucking files just to figure out what the hell is colouring that button.

- Minimalist architecture
- Global styles handled in one place (`index.css`), with Tailwind used directly in components — no scattered theme files or cryptic utility wrappers
- Root styling that won't fight against what you want to do at the page level

## About

This is a blank canvas for you to create your layouts.

It’s relatively unencumbered, so you can be as flexible as you need to be. Edit global styles in `index.css` (including colours, hyperlink hover interactions, etc.) and style components or one-off elements using Tailwind utility classes.

### Features

- 🌗 Dark mode toggle (via `@shadcn/ui`)
- 📱 Mobile-responsive navbar with sliding sheet menu
- 🎨 Easy-to-edit theme with OKLCH color definitions
- 🧼 Clean file structure with no opinionated folder hell
- 🔨 shadcn-ui components, functional and highly customisable

### Notes

- The header is positioned `absolute` and will **overlap** your content — so don’t forget to offset your first `div` accordingly (e.g., with `mt-30`).
- There are comments throughout the codebase to help you navigate and tweak things easily.
- Built with React Router, Tailwind, and ShadCN — but you can easily swap parts out.

### Getting Started

#### 1. Install Node.js and Yarn

If you haven’t already, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (recommended: LTS version).

Then install Yarn globally:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

#### 2. Clone the repository
Follow the instructions on GitHub to clone this repository.

#### 3. Install dependencies

On your terminal, run this:

```bash
yarn install
```

#### 4. Start the development server

You can start the development server using:
```bash
yarn dev
```

Head to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) — this is Vite’s default dev server address, but yours may vary.

### Accessibility

Basic accessibility is supported out of the box via semantic HTML and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.dev)'s focus-visible patterns. ARIA labels are included in interactive elements like the menu trigger. Further improvements (e.g., keyboard navigation across the sheet menu) are welcome contributions!

If you have any questions or bug reports, please feel free to raise an issue or reach out to me through the links on my profile.

⚠️ This is sort of my first time creating a derivative of a webdev project into a shareable artefact, so I would appreciate any feedback and advice!
